Blockchain and cryptocurrency. Work in progress and purely educational.

### Features
- BLAKE3 Hashing (faster and more secure than SHA)
- Hybrid Encryption to reduce size of hashes (WIP)

### Goals

I wanted to learn more about blockchain, and so I built one. I got a lot of practice with cryptography and I more or less understand the concept here.
I also wanted to write a faster API. I am planning on writing another variant in Go soon, and using gevent and PyPy to speed this one up.
A lot of this is so I can also play around with and test concepts, so please don't try to use this as an actual crypto until I figure that stuff out.

### To-Do

**This is a Work In Progress**

- Hybrid Encryption
- Verification of blocks
- Verifying transactions
- Snapshotting transactions
- Consensus Algorithm
- Merging chains
- Gevent and PyPy
- Code Cleanup

Also Do:
- Go Rewrite


### Disclaimer

This is a work in progress and purely educational. As of right now, this is not intended to be an actual cryptocurrency and is instead intended for me to learn and play with concepts. Please **do not use!!!!**
